Run your own God. Good for apps that run in userspace (like, all your Rails apps and their dependencies.)
I'm also sick of giving userspace hooks for apps I deploy to a system-level God process.

Geared toward starting Web services with Thin, but also provides handy defaults for whatever else
you may need to run.
